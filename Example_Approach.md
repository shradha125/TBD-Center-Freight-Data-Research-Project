### Approach to Freight Transportation Research

To create a comprehensive approach to freight transportation research that aligns with the given policy goals, the data representation must be structured to incorporate policies, parameters, simulation, and outcome measurements. Here's a detailed plan:

#### Goals
- **Primary Goals:**
  - Make the last mile more efficient.
  - Green the last mile.
- **Specific Objectives:**
  - Reduce congestion in residential neighborhoods.
  - Increase curb space for deliveries.
  - Develop urban consolidation centers.
  - Meet freight vehicle parking demand.
  - Promote sustainable delivery methods and electrify trucks.
  - Shift mode from road to water and rail.

#### Policy Changes
- **Policy Adjustments:**
  - Retiming deliveries.
  - Adjusting truck traffic regulations.
  - Expanding curb space.
  - Implementing urban consolidation centers.
  - Regulating parking supply and demand.
  - Introducing sustainable and electric delivery vehicles.
  - Encouraging alternative transportation modes.

#### Simulation Response to Policy Changes
- **Simulation Setup:**
  - **Input Data:** Vehicle metrics, freight activity types, parking duration, parking demand, parking supply, freight trip dynamics.
  - **Policy Inputs:** Changes in regulations, curb space, consolidation centers, vehicle types, and delivery timings.
  - **Petri-net Parameters:** Variables that define the states and transitions within the Petri-net model.

- **Simulation Process:**
  1. **Initialize:** Start with current policy settings and freight data.
  2. **Policy Application:** Apply policy changes to adjust Petri-net parameters.
  3. **Run Simulation:** Generate freight movement and parking behavior over a defined period.
  4. **Stochastic Elements:** Include variability to reflect real-world conditions.

#### Measuring Outcomes/Goals from Simulation
- **Outcome Metrics:**
  - Average speed of vehicles.
  - Distribution and density of trucks.
  - Parking occupancy rates.
  - Fuel consumption and emissions.
  - Number of deliveries and trip durations.
  - Compliance with delivery and parking regulations.

- **Evaluation Process:**
  - **Data Collection:** Gather simulated data on vehicle metrics, parking dynamics, and freight trips.
  - **Performance Comparison:** Compare simulation results with target values to assess policy effectiveness.
  - **Error/Loss Calculation:** Compute discrepancies between simulated outcomes and policy goals.

#### Data Representation Needs
- **Data Elements:**
  - **Vehicle Metrics:** Type, classification, weight, engine type, load factor, number of deliveries, fuel consumption, speed.
  - **Freight Activity:** Professional activity, establishment type, commodity type.
  - **Parking Duration:** Distance to establishment, delivery and arrival times, parking behavior.
  - **Parking Demand:** Arrival rates, locations, occupancy rates, illegal parking.
  - **Parking Supply:** Space dimensions, locations, types, loading zones.
  - **Freight Trip Dynamics:** Trip origins and destinations, GPS trajectories.

### Comprehensive Approach

1. **Define Policy Goals:**
   - Determine the specific objectives for last-mile efficiency and sustainability.

2. **Identify Policy Parameters:**
   - List all adjustable parameters (e.g., delivery times, vehicle restrictions, curb space).

3. **Data Integration:**
   - Collect and integrate data from various sources (NYC DOT, AVL, ATRI) focusing on vehicle metrics, parking, and freight activities.

4. **Model Setup:**
   - Configure the Petri-net model to include all relevant parameters and data elements.
   - Define the initial state based on current policies and freight data.

5. **Simulation Execution:**
   - Apply policy changes and run the simulation to predict freight movements and parking dynamics.
   - Use stochastic elements to mimic real-world variability.

6. **Outcome Measurement:**
   - Gather simulated data and calculate performance metrics.
   - Compare against policy goals and compute error/loss.

7. **Feedback and Adjustment:**
   - Use the error/loss information to iteratively adjust policy parameters.
   - Optimize policies to achieve desired outcomes.

### Example Flow

1. **Policy Input:** "Retiming deliveries to non-peak hours and increasing curb space by 20%."
2. **Petri-net Parameters:** Adjust delivery time windows and curb space capacity in the model.
3. **Simulation:** Run the simulation to observe changes in average speed, truck distribution, and parking occupancy.
4. **Outcome Measurement:** Measure the average speed, number of deliveries, and occupancy rates.
5. **Error Calculation:** Compare with target metrics (e.g., increase in average speed by 10%, reduction in illegal parking by 15%).
6. **Adjustment:** Fine-tune delivery times and curb space allocation based on simulation results.
7. **Iterate:** Repeat the process to refine policies and achieve optimal results.

This structured approach ensures that policy changes are systematically evaluated and optimized, providing actionable insights for improving freight transportation efficiency and sustainability.
