## Literature Review on Machine Learning Applications in Freight Transportation and Logistics

The integration of machine learning (ML) techniques in freight transportation and logistics has revolutionized predictive modeling, efficiency improvements, and operational insights. Valatsos et al. (2022) examined the use of ensemble learning techniques to predict critical time intervals for an international freight company. Utilizing Bagging, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Natural Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, the study measured prediction accuracy through Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), highlighting the effectiveness of ensemble learning in improving time interval predictions across multiple routes in Europe ([Valatsos et al., 2022](https://dl-acm-org.ccny-proxy1.libr.ccny.cuny.edu/doi/10.1145/3503823.3503833)). Hughes et al. (2019) addressed the challenge of limited and privacy-sensitive mobility data by employing deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to generate synthetic data, enhancing the utility and privacy of mobility data for better analysis and application in transportation modeling ([Hughes et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X18314645?casa_token=5Gy06HhmjC4AAAAA:A-wJRrlwFvw3baGPsrbsEJFbpUECONalR3zyQXyPZQsyH5s3FkmRuRNz33ArJ_Rt2gyNqcIzXWg)). Ouadi et al. (2020) proposed a hybrid machine-learning framework combining several algorithms to create urban zones for freight consolidation. This approach involved clustering techniques like k-means and k-medoids for demand segmentation, followed by predictive modeling using SVMs and decision trees to enhance logistics planning and zoning accuracy ([Ouadi et al., 2020](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ccny-proxy1.libr.ccny.cuny.edu/document/9353901)). Hughes et al. (2019) utilized various machine learning methodologies, including lasso regression, ridge regression, and elastic net, to predict stop delivery times from GPS data. The study's classification approach employed naive Bayes, logistic regression, and neural networks to determine if stop times would exceed predefined thresholds, showcasing the practical application of ML in improving delivery efficiency ([Hughes et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X18314645?casa_token=5Gy06HhmjC4AAAAA:A-wJRrlwFvw3baGPsrbsEJFbpUECONalR3zyQXyPZQsyH5s3FkmRuRNz33ArJ_Rt2gyNqcIzXWg)). Li and Bai (2016) focused on travel time predictions for freight vehicles using Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) models. They leveraged trajectory data to perform pre-start and post-start predictions, achieving high accuracy and demonstrating the value of real-time data in dynamic scheduling and planning ([Li & Bai, 2016](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ccny-proxy1.libr.ccny.cuny.edu/document/7838286)). Gutmann et al. (2021) developed a model to predict truck parking occupancy using a fusion of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This approach, tested with real-world data, provided accurate predictions for various time horizons, aiding in better parking management for truck drivers ([Gutmann et al., 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffutr.2021.693708/full)). Pinjari et al. (2014) utilized truck GPS data to develop algorithms for measuring average speeds and trip characteristics on Florida’s highways. This research highlighted the application of ML in converting large datasets into actionable insights for transportation planning ([Pinjari et al., 2014](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/27807)). Errousso et al. (2020) proposed a dynamic parking management system predicting space availability using historical data. The study explored ensemble regression methods like Random Forest and LightGBM to improve prediction accuracy, demonstrating significant potential for urban logistics ([Errousso et al., 2020](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.ccny-proxy1.libr.ccny.cuny.edu/document/9353890)). Yang et al. (2023) conducted a comprehensive survey on diffusion models, highlighting their application in image synthesis, video generation, and molecule design. This research provided a foundation for understanding diffusion models and their potential applications in generative modeling ([Yang et al., 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3626235?casa_token=dzWXYo2eR1oAAAAA%3AB330awEm-SOLEJcFrvvVXAcwAPY3zh4IpAdjVrHzniuNnf3NdHVMV6bRo7oNC8NC7OMgmBw2yn7Ojw)). Ludowieg et al. (2023) developed a predictive model for freight vehicles’ demand for loading zones in urban environments, using ML techniques to optimize urban freight operations ([Ludowieg et al., 2023](https://doi-org.ccny-proxy1.libr.ccny.cuny.edu/10.1177/03611981221101893)). Lei (2016) presented a framework for anomaly detection in maritime trajectory behavior using AIS data, employing density-based clustering and feature engineering to identify spatial, sequential, and behavioral anomalies, which significantly improves maritime safety and operational efficiency ([Lei, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10115-015-0845-4)). Nichol and Dhariwal (2021) improved denoising diffusion probabilistic models by introducing hybrid objectives and cosine noise schedules to enhance the efficiency and quality of generative models, with applications in image and time-series data imputation ([Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/nichol21a.html)). Araujo and Etemad (2021) proposed an end-to-end deep learning model for predicting parcel delivery times, incorporating weather data and utilizing CNN and ResNet architectures to achieve high accuracy in smart-city applications ([Araujo & Etemad, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2021.3077007)). 

The reviewed studies illustrate the transformative impact of machine learning on freight transportation and logistics. From route time prediction to urban zoning, parking management, and anomaly detection, ML techniques provide robust solutions for enhancing operational efficiency and planning accuracy. Future research should continue to explore hybrid models and real-time data integration to further advance this field.
