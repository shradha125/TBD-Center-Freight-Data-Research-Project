# TBD-Center-Freight-Data-Research-Project

To facilitate responsible data sharing, we aim to transform proprietary geolocated, time series freight data into synthetic counterparts that safeguard privacy while ensuring comparability for researchers engaging in modeling and analysis. Our synthetic data will serve as a resource addressing critical concerns in freight research, including:

1. Safety - Accidents involving trucks can result in severe consequences.
2. Sustainability - CO2 Emissions and Air Pollution Mitigation.
3. Overall impact assessment - The movement of trucks has implications for road infrastructure, and research evaluates the wear and tear caused by heavy-duty vehicles, leading to infrastructure planning and maintenance considerations.
4. Cost efficiency - Research in this area focuses on optimizing delivery routes, minimizing fuel consumption, and reducing overall transportation costs.
5. Goods movement influence - Research explores how disruptions, delays, or inefficiencies in goods movement impact the broader supply chain and business operations.
6. Parking challenges - Urban areas face challenges related to truck parking, impacting traffic flow and local businesses. Research explores urban planning solutions to address parking challenges while ensuring efficient goods delivery. Innovations such as smart parking systems and real-time parking availability tracking aim to alleviate the difficulties associated with truck parking in both urban and remote areas.

To initiate this process, will conduct a comprehensive review of related research papers and delve into existing literature to gain insights into prior work and identify areas for future improvement. Subsequently, we will focus on understanding how to validate the synthetic data, ensuring its fidelity to the original dataset, thus providing a reliable foundation for research endeavors.

Some sites I will go through for now to explore Literature Review:
1. https://scholar.google.com/
2. https://www.ieee.org/
3. https://www.jstor.org/
4. https://in.sagepub.com/en-in/sas/home
5. https://dl.acm.org/subject/ai
6. https://arxiv.org/
7. https://link.springer.com/ 

As part of first step, I plan to work on Literature Review. Meticulously document and cite the papers I review during my research for the project. For each paper, I will provide a concise yet comprehensive paragraph summarizing its key findings and contributions. This approach ensures transparency in my literature review process, allowing for clear attribution of ideas and insights to their respective sources. By incorporating citations in this manner, I aim to build a robust foundation for my own work while acknowledging the valuable contributions of prior research in the field.
