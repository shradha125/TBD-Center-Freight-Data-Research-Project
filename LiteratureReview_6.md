**Findings**
- Supervised Learning: Predominantly used across various logistics applications, especially for intermodal transportation, demand uncertainty, and user behavior.
- Unsupervised Learning: Less frequently used, with limited applications in clustering problems like k-Means.
- Reinforcement Learning: Increasingly used for complex decision-making problems, such as route optimization and resource allocation.
