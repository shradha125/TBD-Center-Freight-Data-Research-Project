### Specific Policy for Parking Management

#### Policy Overview
**Policy**: Implement a dynamic parking management system to optimize the utilization of loading zones (LZ) in NYC and reduce illegal parking incidents.

**Relevant Dataset**: Dataset D (AVL Data).

**Goal**: Enhance curbside management by improving the availability and usage of loading zones, minimizing idling times, and reducing illegal parking.

   - **Recommendations**: Offer insights into optimal LZ allocation strategies, idling reduction measures, and potential areas for policy adjustments.
   - **Scenario Comparisons**: Present comparisons of different scenarios to help policymakers choose the most effective implementation strategy.

### Steps in Detail

1. **Define Policy Inputs**:
   - **Dynamic LZ Allocation**: Develop an algorithm that uses real-time AVL data to dynamically allocate LZs based on current demand and availability. This algorithm can take into account factors such as truck arrival rates, current occupancy, and predicted demand.
   - **Idling Time Reduction Measures**: Implement policies that limit the amount of time a truck can idle at an LZ. Use AVL data to monitor compliance and issue warnings or fines for violations.
   - **Incentives for Compliance**: Provide benefits such as reduced parking fees or priority LZ access for trucks that comply with idling regulations and use LZs efficiently.

2. **Dataset Selection and Preparation**:
   - **Dataset D (AVL Data)**: Extract relevant columns from the AVL dataset, such as `huntspt_avl.gpslat`, `huntspt_avl.gpslong`, `huntspt_avl.ignition_status`, `huntspt_avl.msgtime`, and `huntspt_avl.speed`.
   - **Data Cleaning**: Address GPS inaccuracies and temporal gaps by applying data cleaning techniques such as interpolation and smoothing.

3. **Representation**:
   - **Data Scope**: Focus on key delivery zones and high-traffic areas where LZ demand is highest.
   - **Data Metrics**: Use metrics such as truck GPS coordinates to identify LZ locations, ignition status to detect idling, and speed patterns to monitor truck movements.
   - **Simulation Model**: Use spatial-temporal analysis to simulate truck movements and parking behaviors under different policy scenarios.
   - **Spatial Representation**: Use GIS tools to visualize LZ locations, idling hotspots, and parking behaviors.

4. **Simulation**:
   - **Modeling Approach**: Develop a GNN or RNN model to predict parking demand and truck movements based on historical AVL data. This model can simulate the impact of dynamic LZ allocation and idling reduction measures.
   - **Policy Parameters**: Include parameters for dynamic LZ allocation (e.g., allocation frequency, demand thresholds) and idling reduction measures (e.g., maximum idling time).
   - **Run Simulations**: Generate multiple scenarios with different policy parameters to evaluate their impact on LZ utilization, idling times, and illegal parking incidents.

5. **Outputs and Metrics**:
   - **LZ Occupancy Rate**: Calculate the percentage of time each LZ is occupied.
   - **Idling Times**: Measure the average and total idling times for trucks at LZs.
   - **Illegal Parking Incidents**: Count the number of illegal parking incidents detected.
   - **Delivery Efficiency**: Evaluate changes in delivery times and on-time delivery rates.

6. **Error/Loss Calculation**:
   - **Define Loss Functions**: Develop loss functions that quantify deviations from desired outcomes, such as differences between predicted and actual LZ occupancy rates, idling times, and illegal parking incidents.
   - **Policy Effectiveness**: Use machine learning regression to identify which policy parameters have the most significant impact on the desired outcomes.

7. **Interpretation for Policy-Makers**:
   - **Impact Analysis**: Create detailed reports and visualizations showing the impact of dynamic LZ allocation and idling reduction measures on LZ utilization, idling times, and illegal parking incidents.
   - **Recommendations**: Provide insights into optimal LZ allocation strategies, idling reduction measures, and areas for policy adjustments based on the simulation results.
   - **Scenario Comparisons**: Present comparisons of different scenarios to help policymakers choose the most effective implementation strategy.
